    "While bowling, this week, an interesting question came up: is it possible to get every score from 1 to 450 in a game of five pin bowling? Or, to flip it around, is there a score that you can never get no matter how fancy your bowling? The answer is not immediately obvious!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The rules of five pin bowling\n",
    "\n",
    "[Five pin bowling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-pin_bowling) uses five pins but, unlike ten pin bowling, the pins are worth different amounts. Notably no pin is worth 1, and so a score of *1* is the first impossible score.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {#fig-scoring}\n",
    "![](attachment:31ff655b-8ba9-40cd-a9af-7ff1538b1345.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The points value of each pin in five-pin bowling.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Like ten pin bowling, if a strike or a spare is recorded in a given frame then the scores of subsequent ball(s) are counted in that frame, as well as the frame in which they were thrown. So, for example, if I throw a strike in the first frame I don't actually know what to write on the score sheet for the first frame until the second, and possibly third, frames have been thrown. I know it is *at least* 15, but until I throw the next ball it could be anything up to 45. This was what initially gave me pause. It adds a layer of complexity since the possible scores for a given frame depend on what happens next.\n",
    "\n",
    "By symmetry, though, this way of scoring is equivalent to every strike and spare adding a *multiplier* to the next frame, and each frame is just scored counting whatever the pinfall is and applying the multiplier (no looking backwards). So, if I throw a strike in the first frame, then I record a *15* for the first frame and *double count* the next two balls. If I have thrown two strikes in a row then I *triple count* the first subsequent ball and *double count* the next one. This is a weird way of managing a score sheet, for bowlers, but makes it a lot easier to reason about the possible scores, since you don't have to constantly be looking back two or three frames. This *passing forward* score sheet looks different to a regular one: The maximum score for the first frame is now 15, and for the second frame 30, and in the tenth frame it is possible to score *90* points. On a conventional score sheet the max score in any frame is 45.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trying everything\n",
    "\n",
    "While hanging out at the lanes a few obvious impossible scores got thrown out: a *1*, obviously, but also a *449* -- there's no way to throw a 14 with the last ball in the tenth frame. But the question still lingered: are there any other gaps? It was not immediately obvious, to my bowling team, how you would figure that out without checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe we can brute-force this and try every conceivable bowling game? However there are *a lot* of possible bowling games. As a first pass, there are thirty balls thrown in a game and each ball has *up to* fourteen possible pinfall scores (0 through 15 excluding 1 and 14). This would give *14<sup>30</sup>* possible bowling games. Even if it took a single nanosecond to evaluate each game that would take longer than the current age of the universe to work through.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that's not a great upper bound, it doesn't take into account the rules of bowling: you can only knock down up to five pins in any given frame, for example if the first ball scores a *13* then the second ball doesn't get to choose from fourteen possibilities, it gets to chose from two: 0 and 2. Still, it is going to be a large number. The vast majority of those games are going to be completely redundant, since we are only looking for scores from 2 to 450."

    "## Nothing fancy\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest case to look at is when one never throws a strike or spare. In this case the possible scores for each frame are the same: just what you can get from knocking down any subset of the pins. This happens to be anything from 0 to 15 except *1* and *14*. That's easy enough to see just by inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also leads to a (kinda loose) argument for why you should be able to get anything from 0 to 150 except *1* and *149*:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are playing game with *n* frames and your goal is a score $x \\le 15 n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $x \\not \\equiv 1 (\\textrm{mod} 15)$ and $x \\not \\equiv 14 (\\textrm{mod} 15)$ then you can always get from a multiple of 15 to the final score in one frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $x \\equiv 1 (\\textrm{mod} 15)$ or $x \\equiv 14 (\\textrm{mod} 15)$ then you can't get from a multiple of 15 to the final score in one frame, this is because you cannot score *1* or *14* in one frame. You can score 1 more than a multiple of 15 if you have two frames remaining: score a *13* in the first and a *2* in the next. Similarly you can score 1 less than a multiple of 15 if you have two frames remaining: score a *7* in the first frame and a *7* in the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since for any *x* such that $1 \\lt x \\le 15 (n-1)$ there are $\\ge 2$ frames remaining, all of those scores can thus be achieved. \n",
    "\n",
    "What remains is the *x* such that $15(n-1) \\lt x \\lt 15 n$ and $x \\equiv 14 (\\textrm{mod} 15)$, this single score is not achievable in a game with no strikes and spares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is all to say there are only two impossible scores: *1* and *15n -1* or *149* in a standard ten frame game.\n",
    "\n",
    "I suspect that, if you wanted to put the work in, you could extend this argument to include spares and strikes, with all of the complications around how the 10th frame is scored. But an alternative is to just look through all possible scores and try and find a game that achieves it, using this general approach as a guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is pretty easy to do when only looking at the case where there are no strikes or spares: I generate a list of possible scores for a single frame (a possible move I can take towards my goal), sorted largest to smallest."
