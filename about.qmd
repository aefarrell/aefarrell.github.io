## Showing My Work

Whenever I run into a problem I do what everyone does: I google it. Frequently some random blog comes up detailing everything I need to know about solving the problem. So, I figured, if I was already doing the work for my own interest, might as well publish it? Be the blog I want to see in the world, or something like that.

That's where these notebooks come from, they are mostly worked examples of things I've either had to do through my work -- I'm a chemical engineer by day -- or something I stumbled across and just thought was interesting. Hopefully you find them useful and, if you find any mistakes, let me know!

## Caveat Emptor

While I may be an engineer, I am not *your* engineer. You should not blindly follow whatever you read on anyone's blog, and instead see this as a starting point for your own work and research. I try to provide references, so you can check my work and my assumptions, and these can be very fruitful starting points to read more of the context around what I'm doing. It's entirely possible that there is a better model out there, in the same reference that I use, for your particular problem! Also I often simplify the example I'm doing to zoom in on details I'm interested  in while glossing over pieces that are important to a more fulsome engineering analysis.

And let's not forget that I can simply be wrong!
